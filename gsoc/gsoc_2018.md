MyHDL is participating in the 2018
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/),
as a sub-org under the
[FOSSi](https://fossi-foundation.org/)
organization umbrella.

Go to the [MyHDL forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/t/students-thinking-about-applying-to-myhdl-for-gsoc/164/2) and/or the [FOSSi GSoC page](https://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc18-ideas.html)
and introduce yourself and your interests!

MyHDL Project Introduction
===========================
[MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org) is a Python package that extends Python
as a hardware description language (HDL).  MyHDL empowers implementation
of complex digital circuits that can be targeted towards ASIC and
FPGA technologies.

[Jan Decaluwe](http://www.jandecaluwe.com/) is the creator and
[BDFL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). The
MyHDL project has been around for many years and has had many successes
bringing a modern and software influenced approach to HDL development.
MyHDL has been used for various FPGA projects and numerous
[ASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)
projects [1] [2].

The following are good starting points to learn more about
MyHDL:

   * [MyHDL Manual Intro](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/manual/preface.html)
   * [Why MyHDL](http://www.myhdl.org/start/why.html)
   * [What MyHDL is Not](http://www.myhdl.org/start/whatitisnot.html)


MyHDL Community
===============
The [MyHDL forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/)
and the [myhdl gitter channel](https://gitter.im/myhdl/myhdl)
can be used to interact with the MyHDL community.  Most questions
can be answered in one of these two outlets.

   * [MyHDL forum](http://discourse.myhdl.org/)
   * [MyHDL gitter](https://gitter.im/myhdl/myhdl)
   * [MyHDL repository on github](http://github.com/myhdl/myhdl)
   * [MyHDL on twitter](https://twitter.com/MyHDL)
   * IRC #myhdl channel on [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net)

Questions can also be posted to:

   * [FPGArelated forum](https://www.fpgarelated.com/forums)
   * [Stackoverflow myhdl](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/myhdl)


The gitter channel is informal and typically a question
will be part of a time-limited conversation.  On the forum
more users/developers will have a chance to comment on the question
and the question will receive more feedback over time.  

Before a question
is posted to the forum or gitter care should be taken to construct
a useful question.  Simple guidelines for posting questions to
the community:

   1. Limit the scope of the questions.
   2. Briefly state what is to be accomplish.
   3. Give a small example embedded in the question.
   4. Clearly state the question in the context of the
      simplified problem.
   5. It is ok to link original code (or attach) as a
      reference but it should not be required to answer
      the question.

Example, don't post code and state: "it doesn't work, help".  
Determine where the issues is and create a specific question
to the problems independent of the context of the project.
The easier the question is to understand and test (e.g
removing extraneous information) the faster the question
will be answered.

Mentors will be in a position to help dig through the project
code.  To get the highest probability of a timely and useful
answer the above recommendation should be used when posting
to the mailing-list.

This exhaustive essay on,
[interacting and getting questions answered by asking
well-thought questions](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html),
is a good guide.


Writing Your GSoC Application
=============================
A [common template](http://dev.myhdl.org/gsoc/gsoc_app_template.html)
is available to help bootstrap the student proposals.  For more
information on GSoC see the [GSoC website](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)
in particular the [student FAQ](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#students)
is a good place to start for new students and the [student guide](http://en.flossmanuals.net/GSoCStudentGuide/)
is a thorough review of the program.


Getting Started with MyHDL
==========================

Using MyHDL
-----------

The [MyHDL manual](http://docs.myhdl.org/en/latest/index.html)
outlines how to design digital circuits with MyHDL.  MyHDL
[installation instructions](http://www.myhdl.org/start/installation.html)
thoroughly cover installing the MyHDL package.

The following
is a list of additional examples and projects that can be used
as first exercises and references:

   * [MyHDL Examples](http://www.myhdl.org/docs/examples/)
   * [MyHDL List of Resources](http://www.fpgarelated.com/showarticle/43.php)


Contributing to MyHDL Package
-----------------------------
The MyHDL project has outlined a
[development process](http://dev.myhdl.org/guide/guide.html)
that should be followed by each participant.  This includes
writing [enhancement proposals](http://dev.myhdl.org/meps/mep-001.html)
for projects that contribute directly to the MyHDL package.  Certain
project ideas are based on existing MEPs.  The student proposal
will be natural start to a MEP if needed.


Project Ideas
=============

All projects require programming in Python, previous knowledge of
HDL design, and many of the MyHDL specific projects (i.e. non-cores)
require experience with compilers (familiarity with the Python
compiler package desirable).



MyHDL Package Project Ideas
---------------------------

### Digital filter blocks ###
This project includes developing various digital filters with
MyHDL and integrating the filter-blocks with
[PyFDA](https://github.com/chipmuenk/pyfda).  The filter-blocks
will be added to the [`filter-blocks`](https://github.com/cfelton/filter-blocks)
repository.  The student is encouraged to start with simple digital
filters and use the tools to verify and demonstrate the performance
of the filters.  After a basic filter or two is completed it
is expected the student will complete a more complex digital filter,
examples: systolic structure, non-linear estimation filters,
modular shared-resource structures, etc.  

The potential mentors for this project are:

   1. [Christopher L. Felton ](https://www.fpgarelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Christopher_Felton.php),
      cfelton on IRC, [@FeltonChris](https://twitter.com/FeltonChris) on
      twitter, and [@cfelton on github](https://github.com/cfelton)

   2. [Christian Muenker](http://www.pyfda.org),  
      [@chipmuenk on github](https://github.com/chipmuenk)


### Interface driven Ethernet core ###
This project involves extending the Ethernet core that was
developed in a previous GSoC to be an "interface driven"
design.  The core is to be updated and extended with the
interfaces provided in the `rhea` or `crux` packages.

The following example illustrates the idea of the interface
driven design - the details will be developed with the student.

```python
def example(...)
    glbl = Global()         # clock and resets
    ethcfg = EthConfig()    # contains all the setup info
    ethc = EthController()  # main data interface to the eth

    # In this example, there are three blocks that are interfacing
    # with the Ethernet controller.
    b1 = ethc.get_branch()
    pkt1_inst = packet_type_a_handler(...)

    b2 = ethc.get_branch()
    pkt2_inst = packet_type_b_handler(...)


    b3 = ethc.get_branch()
    pkt3_inst = packet_type_c_handler(...)

    eth_inst = eth_core(glbl, ethc, ethcfg)
    # get the arbitration logic, handles
    arb_inst = ethc.arbitrate()   
```

It is desirable, but not required, that the student have a
development board with an tri-mode (10/100/1000) Ethernet phy.
